            <p>Hello! My name is Tanmai Buyyanapragada and I am a sophomore Electrical Engineering Major at Texas A&M University. I am currently looking for an internship over the summer. I would love to learn more about both the software and hardware worlds, both being huge interests of mine. From a young age, I was exposed to the programming world. This interest really started when I was just 5 years old. I still remember the pride I felt staring at the "Hello, World!" that I had just printed on the screen. I was amazed. From that day on, I knew that programming was something I wanted to explore. It wasn't until our blender broke that I realized how amazing hardware was, too. My dad and I took the blender apart, looking at the different components. I was so surprised at how complex the simple machine really was. It completely changed my perspective, changing the way I saw the world. I realized that electrical engineering, a mix of both worlds, was the perfect major for me!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Feel free to click on the tabs below to learn more about me! Welcome to my personal website!</p>

        <div id="projects" class="content">
            <h1>Personal Projects</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project 1 - Thermostat:</strong> I used Arduino systems to build this thermostat. The basic components were an LCD screen to display the output, a thermistor, a simple program to run, and a breadboard-based wiring system. After completing the circuit, the temperature is returned in Celsius.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Project 2 - Spinning Toy:</strong> This project was one of my favorites because I was able to gift it to my nephew and because it used objects from around the house. Using copper wires, recycled cardboard, an electric toothbrush, hot glue, and some paper, I was able to repurpose the motor in the electric toothbrush and create a little monkey toy that could spin on its base when a switch is turned on to run the motor.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Project 3 - Light with Light Switch:</strong> This was one of my easier projects because there was no software programming needed. I used a LED light bulb, wires, a breadboard, a resistor, and a push button switch. This result is pretty self-explanatory, the final circuit being a light that turned on an off as a result of a switch being pushed.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Project 4 - My Personal Website:</strong> Times are changing, and so are resumes. That was why I decided to make this website. I used HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript in order to create this aesthetically pleasing website. It is like my digital portfolio, and I will keep improving it.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Project 5 - Meta Tic-Tac-Toe:</strong> This project is pretty self explanatory. I used Python to create a Meta Tic-Tac-Toe game, a game where 9 different Tic-Tac-Toe games are played at once. I am currently in the process of remaking this game in the language I am learning right now, C++.</li>
